            <p>I have started my journey to become a web developer. I know the path will not be as smooth as people expect it to be. Since my background is nowhere related to Web Development, yet I believe the struggle to learn anything new has nothing to do with our previous experience of the subject. Rather the process of learning is all we can rely on.</p>

            <h3>To become a web developer</h3>
            <p>I already learned the basic HTML and CSS. I can build any simple website. I can even teach my grandma how to make simple website. My goal is to build 3 websites and learn advanced topics.</p>
